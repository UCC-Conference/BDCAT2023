======================================================

The IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data
Computing, Applications, and Technologies (BDCAT) is a
premier annual conference series aiming to provide a
platform for researchers from both academia and
industry to present new discoveries in the broad area
of big data computing and applications. The conference
features keynotes, posters, workshops and a student
symposium. BDCAT 2023 will be held in conjunction with
the 16th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility
and Cloud Computing (UCC 2023) in Taormina, Messina,
Italy.

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished
research manuscripts in all areas of Big Data computing,
applications and technologies, as well as on related
scaling data analysis. Topics of interest include (but

>> PAPER SUBMISSION
Authors are invited to submit papers electronically
through the following link: 
https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/UCCBDCAT2023

Submitted manuscripts must represent original
unpublished research that is not currently under review
for any other conference or journal. Manuscripts 
are submitted in PDF format and may not exceed ten (10)
ACM-formatted *double-column* pages, including figures,
tables, and references. ll manuscripts undergo a 
double-blind peer-review process and will be reviewed
and judged on correctness, originality, technical
strength, rigor in analysis, quality of results, quality
of presentation, and interest and relevance to the
conference attendees. Your submission is subject to a
determination that you are not under any sanctions by
ACM.

At least one author of each paper must be registered for
the conference in order for the paper to be published in
the proceedings. The conference proceedings will be
published by the ACM and made available online via the
IEEE Xplore Digital Library and ACM Digital Library.
