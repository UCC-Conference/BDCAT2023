                <p>
                    The IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications and Technologies (BDCAT) a premier IEEE/ACM conference aiming to provide a platform for researchers from both academia and industry to present new
                    discoveries in the broad area of big data computing and applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This will be the 10th BDCAT in a successful conference series of community-driven events. Previous events were held in Vancouver, USA (BDCAT 2022), Leister, UK (BDCAT 2021), online (BDCAT 2020), Auckland, New Zealand (BDCAT 2019),
                    Zurich, Switzerland (BDCAT 2018), Austin, Texas, USA (BDCAT 2017), Shanghai, China (BDCAT 2016), Limassol, Cyprus (BDCAT 2015), London, UK (BDCAT 2014). BDCAT 2023 will be held in conjunction with the 16th IEEE/ACM International
                    Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC 2023) in Taormina, Messina, Italy.
                </p>
                <p>Proposals for workshops should be submitted in PDF format, must not exceed 2 pages in length and contain the following information.</p>

                <h2>RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
                <p>Workshop chair(s) will be responsible for the following:</p>

                    <li>Setup the submission system of your choice.</li>
                    <li>Invite TPC members.</li>
                    <li>
                        Produce a web site and a “Call for Papers/Participation” for their workshop. The URL should be sent to the BDCAT Workshops chairs. The call must make it clear that the workshop is open to all members of the Cloud, Edge, Fog,
                        Big Data, Grid, and Cluster Computing community. It should mention that at least one author of each accepted submission must attend the workshop and that all workshop participants must register under the BDCAT 2023 workshop
                        day registration fee or the conference fee. The CfP should make it clear that the registration of at least one author requires the full (non-student, non-workshop) rate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensure that all workshop papers are a maximum of 6 pages in length, following the main conference format. It is the responsibility of the workshop organizers to ensure that this page limit has been adhered to. Additional pages
                        may be purchased (in some circumstances) subject to approval by the proceedings chair.
                    </li>
                    <li>Provide a brief description of the workshop for the conference web page and program.</li>
                    <li>Select the participants and the format of the workshop. </li>
                    <li>Advertise the workshop beyond the conference web page.</li>
                    <li>Assist in producing a camera-ready version of the workshop proceedings.</li>
                    <li>The conference will take place in person and one workshop organizer should attend the conference to take care of the workshop sessions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The BDCAT 2023 Conference Organizing Committee will be responsible for the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide a link to the workshop's web site on the main conference site.</li>
                    <li>Provide logistics support and a meeting place for the workshop.</li>
                    <li>In conjunction with the organizers, determine the workshop date and time.</li>
                    <li>Provide copies of the workshop proceedings to attendees. Workshop proceedings will be published by ACM, following the BDCAT conference proceedings for the current year.</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <h2>Details and Important Notes</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        If the workshop is too small (i.e., it does not attract enough submissions) the BDCAT 2023 Organizing Committee may decide to merge that workshop with another. We encourage workshop organizers to attract a large community. In
                        extreme situations we may also cancel workshops if there are not enough submissions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Workshop organizers must ensure that suitable quality measures have been taken to ensure that the accepted papers are of high quality. All papers must be reviewed by an international Technical Program Committee with a minimum
                        of 3 reviews per paper. The workshop organizers should also try to observe an acceptance rate that is no higher than 50%.
                    </li>
                    <li>Workshops are not automatically endorsed by ACM and should not use the names of these organizations in their titles.</li>
